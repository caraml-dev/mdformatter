# Candy

Caramel candy, or "caramels", and sometimes called "toffee" (though this also refers to other types of candy), is a soft, dense, chewy candy made by boiling a mixture of milk or cream, sugar(s), glucose, butter, and vanilla (or vanilla flavoring). The sugar and glucose are heated separately to reach {{ caramel_boiling_point | default('130Â°C') }}; the cream and butter are then added which cools the mixture. Upon completion of cooking, vanilla or any additional flavorings and salt are added.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Adding the vanilla or flavorings earlier would result in them burning off at the high temperatures. Adding salt earlier in the process would result in inverting the sugars as they cooked. The final mixture should not be heated beyond {{ caramel_final_temperature }}.
